# Hackclub Stock Exchange
The hackclub stock exchange will be a python application that calculates the value of stocks using @Overseer data. The stock prices will be accesable through an API, allowing anybody to create their own Stock Brocker App/ Website. 
Features are still being determined, if you have any suggestions please suggest them in #hc-stock-exchange. 

## Current planned Stock Exchange features:
    - ability for anyone in the Hackclub slack to issue a stock
    - get stock prices through the API
    - buy stocks (also done through the API)
    - sell stocks
    - see who owns what stocks

Again if you have any suggestions please suggest them in #hc-stock-exchange!

## Why is this project in Python?
RIP, its the only language I know atm :(
And because it is possible so I would like to apply my python skills in this project and improve them as well.
