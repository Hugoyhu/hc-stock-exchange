# Hackclub Stock Exchange
The hackclub stock exchange will be a python application that calculates the value of stocks using @Overseer data. The stock prices will be accesable through an API, allowing anybody to create their own Stock Brocker App/ Website. 
Features are still being determined, if you have any suggestions please suggest them in #hc-stock-exchange. 

## Current planned Stock Exchange features:
    - ability for anyone in the Hackclub slack to issue a stock
    - get stock prices through the API
    - buy stocks (also done through the API)
    - sell stocks
    - see who owns what stocks

Again if you have any suggestions please suggest them in #hc-stock-exchange!

## How stock prices will be calculated?
They will be calculated based on the amount of messages you have sent (this data will be taken from @Overseer). The details have not been figured out yet, so if you have any suggestions you know where to send them.

## Why is this project in Python?
RIP, its the only language I know atm :(
And because it is possible so I would like to apply my python skills in this project and improve them as well.
